üçï Pizza Sales SQL Analysis
üìã Project Description
This project presents a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of a pizza sales database, designed to simulate real-world business questions and analytics scenarios in the food and beverage industry. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights from structured data using SQL queries, enabling better decision-making and performance evaluation.

The dataset consists of four normalized tables: orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types. These collectively capture information about order transactions, pizza types, pricing, sizes, and customer purchase behavior. Using structured queries, this project answers a variety of key business questions such as:

How many unique orders were placed?

What is the total revenue generated?

Which is the highest-priced pizza?

What pizza size is most commonly ordered?

Which pizza types are most popular by quantity and revenue?

How do orders vary by time of day?

What is the average number of pizzas ordered daily?

How does demand vary across different pizza categories?

Each SQL query is designed using proper syntax and best practices, including the use of JOINs, aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG), grouping, filtering, and ordering. The results of these queries have been compiled into a presentation format to make the insights clear and accessible.
